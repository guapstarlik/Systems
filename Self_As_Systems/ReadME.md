## Project Overview - Self As System

This project focuses on reinterpreting personal data in a way that reflects the individual. It involves:

1. Downloading and observing data from different websites
2. Reinterpreting that data to create a personal reflection of one self - 

## Data Sources

- **Spotify**
  

Initially, Instagram data was considered but not used in the final project.

## Project Description

The project creates an interactive timeline using listening data from Spotify and Apple services. Key features include:

**Chronological display** of *music/podcast listening history* through a **vertical timeline.** **Interactivity** will be added to allow users to *drag and drop media*, into a bin to sift through later.  After viewing the timeline users can **sift through** media they **dropped into the bin**, finding what really intrigues them from the pileup. 

## Technical Highlights

- **JavaScript scripting**
- **User interactivity**
- Integration of **Spotify** and **Apple** data
- No external coding libraries used
